# Strings

A string is a sequence of characters. Like in many other programming languages,
a string can be represented by surrounding a givben sequence of characters with
a " at the beginning and at the end.
In Feder strings can contain multiple lines in source code.

In the following example a string is assigned to the object 's' and the object
s is created at the same time.

```
s = "Hello, World!"
```

In the next example a string is assigned to the object 's', but the string
expands over several lines in the source code.

```
s = "I am
a very,
very,
very,
loooong
string"
```
