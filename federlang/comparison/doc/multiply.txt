The program "multiply" multiplies two variables, which were previously defined
as objects (which could prevent an intelligent compiler from multiplying the two
numbers at compile time). After mutliplying the two objects, the program should
save the result and print it to the console.

The program multiplies the two objects 100 times, so that the environment of the
programming language doesn't have a big impact on the time, the "program only"
consumes.

Pseudo-Code:

repeat 100 times
	n0 = 5
	n1 = 7
;

result = n0 * n1
printToConsole (result)
